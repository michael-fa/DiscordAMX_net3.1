# Coding Rules
   1. Comment larger pieces of code, if they're neccessarry. 
   2. Creating a new file should be in their respective namespaces, if you are unsure ask me.
   3. Don't add unnecessary loops or anything that spams the discord api pipe. This is no good for us all.
 [PLUGINS]
   1. No malicious intent when adding plugins. 
   2. Stay inside the program's folder for any files. Create folders if necessary. 
   3. Do not reimplement the pawn wrapper. PLUGIN INTERFACE is coming soon, hook or call the discordamx assemmbly functions in other ways for now on!
