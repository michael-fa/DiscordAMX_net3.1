# DiscordAMX  [![Generic badge](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/michael-fa/DiscordAMX?include_prereleases)](https://github.com/michael-fa/DiscordAMX/releases)

## [Read the Wiki for help](https://github.com/michael-fa/DiscordAMX/wiki)


A .NET Console App that lets you script your Discord Bots using the awesome [PAWN](https://github.com/pawn-lang) scripting language.
The core goal is to make Discord Bots more easier for everyone!
For more about PAWN [click here](https://www.compuphase.com/pawn/pawn.htm).
This project depends heavily on [DSharpPlus](https://dsarpplus.github.io). A .NET Framework package allowing me to interact with Discord's API as easy as possible.

## :construction: ~~EARLY~~ ALPHA

The whole project is still in its alpha, meaning there will be many changes and if you are not experienced in PAWN Scripting you should come back later! Leave a watch! 

## Testers
The current previews are meant for experienced scripters and are only for pure testing.
Run it on windows and make sure you have <b>[.NET Runtime 5.0.*](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0)</b> ! 

**If you are an experienced PAWN coder, and you're interested in testing this (given you can thoroughly test the program on your discord)
I'll offer to host a bot for TESTERS -> I am currently looking for 2-3 official project testers!**

:warning: The current aim of this is self-hosting - remember: NOT SELF-BOT. You need (to rent) a (v)Server running either Linux or Windows on it!
Linux support is coming soon!


## :warning: We're slowly getting towards supporting multiple scripts! If there are problems regarding your scripts, other then your main.amx, report this under Issues! 


## Current Features
* Set the DiscordActivity ('playing, listening, watching') Text 
* Send Messages to any channel 
* Setting timers
* (INI) File Handling !!!
* Private DM Handling
* Thread Support (Messages+Edits, Reactions, ThreadUpdate)
* Multiple guild support
* Multiple script support

 .. see the [Wiki](https://github.com/michael-fa/DiscordAMX/wiki) **for more**!
